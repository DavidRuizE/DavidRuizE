# Hi, I'm David Ruiz 👋  
**Full-Stack Developer | Next.js • TypeScript • Kotlin | Building scalable, real-world applications**

I'm a Systems Engineering graduate focused on creating clean, maintainable, and production-ready software.  
I enjoy building real products used by real users — from healthcare platforms to booking systems and mobile applications.

Currently improving my JavaScript, TypeScript, and React expertise while actively seeking a full-time role in a global development team.
